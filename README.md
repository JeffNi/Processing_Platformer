# Processing_Platformer
Downloading processing at https://processing.org/download/ is required

*This project has been discontinued because I was unfamiliar with how to properly use classes at the time and I don't use Processing anymore.
The code isn't the prettiest, it was made for fun and wasn't intended to be seen by others. I am familiar with how it works so 
I didn't feel the need to improve readability at the time. Mistake.

Supports warp zones, but isn't in the level
Only level one works
Backspace returns to menu 
Customization must be unlocked, in first level collect feather and jump left to unlock magenta skin
